## 💡 Motivation

The goal of this project is to standardize the presentation of all courses at UFSJ ( __*Universidade Federal de São João del Rei*__ ) in an interactive way.

Currently, each course coordinator uses different methods to display course information, such as flowcharts and tables. However, this lack of consistency can be confusing for students.

By creating a standardized approach, this project aims to enhance the accessibility and clarity of course information, making it easier for students to understand their curriculum and plan their academic journey.
